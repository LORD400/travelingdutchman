            Hi everybody! How do you do?
            <br><br>
            Today was the day, we didn't do much, except going to the buffet. Yesterday was a long night, so we weren't so enthusiastic for a early morning. Before anyone was ready to go out, I took a walk to a nearby park to relax a bit and went on back to the hotel.
            <br><br>
            Even though, if we would like to take on an activity, almost everything was closed till at least 4 pm. In the afternoon, Marty and I went on a walk looking for sone lunch and we ended by our hero, a little store with only overpriced stuff and candy... It was a healthy lunch...
            <br><br>
            After around a walk of one and a half hour in search of food it began to heavily rain. Spoiler alert, it was the first and last moment in this vacation!!! 
            <br><br>
            Some time later, we went to an restaurant called Yaso Lamen & Gyoza. Everyone had a different dish of Ramen and it all tasted great! But the quantity was mind bobbling, so much food, we couldn't handle it and had a lot of leftovers... As a dessert there was a bit of muchi and a double espresso (nam-nam-nam).
            <br><br>
            Till the next one!
        </p>
