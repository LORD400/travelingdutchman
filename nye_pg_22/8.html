            Hi everybody! How do you do?
            <br><br>
            Every beginning got an end, especially with vacations... For the positive note, this type of memories are always a blessing to look back to. Before the departure, there is still a whole day ahead. 
            So, we begin totally original, breakfast buffet. Most of them still need to pack the bags, wherefore I have placed my bags in the hotel and went for a walk to the city center. 
            <br><br>
            This time, is was more interested in the little things on the way to the famous square. 
            Seeing the joy on the streets, sun between buildings and a pleasant temperature. 
            Before I arrived by the square, I stopt by a small coin shop a saw six identical old coins from the Portuguese Escudo. 
            Every trip, there has to be a special materialistic. So, I bought them, that we could all look back to an amazing time!
            <br><br>
            When my alone time was a bit extended, there I sat on some rocks by the river amused by the view and sun. 
            Some time later, we met each other where I was relaxing. Live locations are definitely handy. Everyone was hyped about the coin as a memorial :).
            For now, we walk a bit through different streets and sat down on a terras for lunch. 
            The last lunch we had... Pastel the Nata was a must and everything else was irrelevant, except the coffee ;).
            <br><br>
            Expectation is the beginning of healing. We had to believe it, time to go back to the hotel, take our luggage and a taxi to the airport... 
            The waiting and the flight back where without any trouble.  During the flight Marty and I bought in the airplane to celebrate a lot of drinks and looked back on a fantastic time!
            <br><br>
            Thanks everyone for this great time! Romar, Iris, Marty, Anthony and Swenne 
            <br><br>
            By and till the next one!
        </p>
