            Hi everybody! How do you do?
            <br><br>
            All beginnings come to an end, especially with holidays... On a positive note, memories like this are always a blessing to look back on. Before departure there is still a whole day ahead.
            So we start all original, breakfast buffet. Most of them still have to pack their bags, so I put my bags in the hotel luggages room and went for a walk to the center.
            <br><br>
            This time I was more interested in the little things on the way to parça do comércio square.
            Seeing the fun on the street, sun between buildings and a pleasant temperature, I was sold.
            Before arriving at the square, I stopped at a small coin shop and saw six identical old coins of Portuguese Escudo.
            Every trip there must be a special materialistic memorial. So I bought them so we could all look back on a great time!
            <br><br>
            When my alone time was a bit longer, I sat there on some rocks by the river, amused by the view and the sun.
            Some time later we met where I was relaxing. Live locations are definitely useful. Everyone was hyped about the coin as a memorial :).
            For now we walk through different streets and have lunch on a terrace.
            The last lunch we had… Pastel da Nata was a must and everything else was irrelevant except the coffee ;).            
            <br><br>
            Exception is the beginning of healing. We had to believe it, time to go back to the hotel, take our luggage and a taxi to the airport...
            The waiting and the flight back went without any problems. During the flight, Marty and I bought a lot of drinks to celebrate on the plane and looked back on a fantastic time!
            <br><br>
            Thanks everyone for this little adventure! Anthony, Iris, Marty, Romar and Swenne.            
            <br><br>
            By and till the next one!
        </p>
