                Hi everybody! How do you do?
                <br><br>
                Finally it's time for New Year's Eve!!! The night has flown to Lisbon especially to celebrate. For a good night's sleep you need to eat well, so let's start with the breakfast buffet. The plans are a bit different, so we split into two groups for the day.
                Ant and I go to a bouldering gym nearby and the other group goes into town for some shopping. Bouldering in another country was interesting, because we didn't know if the level was harder/easier. We had to go there first.  
                <br><br>
                The bouldering gym was about a 30 minute walk away and when we arrived it was closed... Considering what day it was, it's not surprising. And now? We took an Uber to the next one which was over the highway past the airport. Good news, this one was open, YESSS! And we are going to find out the difficulty of this gym.
                And it was hard, clapping, that's what it's all about. Usually balancing with less power, not our normal gym type, so we were rookies again.
                <br><br>
                Once the workout was done, we took another Uber back to the hotel and cooled down a bit to save our energy. Around 6pm we took a Bolt taxi to the city center, and it was full. Every street was blocked and the car just turned to get there. After 25 min the time just went through the roof and we continued to the hustle and bustle.
                The most important thing is to book a few days in advance to get a table in a restaurant, of course we didn't. We trudged for 20 minutes asking for a table everywhere. Finally our efforts paid off, we got a table at a small "fast" food restaurant. At the end of the dinner we were in time to arrive at parça do comércio square, surrounded by police and thousands of people entering.
                <br><br>
                There was a huge performance on stage with a Portuguese band. With all the people in the square it was a great feeling and start to the night. From 12 o'clock it was a fireworks show of about 15 minutes and moved on to an open air area with food and drink options and pleasant music. When I think of the view we had, I can't describe it (last photo).
                In the end we also went to a club and later split into two different groups 50/50. Some enjoyed the outdoor music more than the club, so everyone had an excellent night and back at the hotel around 5am.
                <br><br>
                When we got back 15 minutes apart, we talked a bit, played cards and went to bed.
                <br><br>
                Till tomorrow!
