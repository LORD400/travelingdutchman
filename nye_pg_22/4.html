                Hi everybody! How do you do?
                <br><br>
                Finally, it's time for New Years Eve!!! The night specially flown to Lisbon to celebrate. For a great night, you have to eat well, so let's begin with the breakfast buffet. Plans are a bit different from each other, therefore we split in two groups for the day. 
                Ant and I are going to a boulder gym in the neighborhood and the other group goes to the city to shop. Bouldering in an other country was interesting, because we didn't know if the level was harder/easier. First we needed to go there.  
                <br><br>
                The boulder gym was about 30 min walking and when we arrived, it was closed... Thinking about what day it was, it's not strange. And now? We took an Uber to the next one which was over the highway past the airport. Good news, this one was open, YESSS! And we going to discover the difficulty of this gym.
                And difficult it was, slaps thats the thing. Mostly balance an less power, not our normal gym type, so we where rookies again.  
                <br><br>
                When the training was done, we took an other Uber back to the hotel, and chilled a bit to save our energy. Around 6 pm we took an Bolt taxi to the city center, and it was packed. Every street was blocked and the car was only turning an trying to get there. After 25 min the time just went through the roof and we walked further to the busyness.
                A Most important thing is to make a reservation some days before to get a table in a restaurant, of course we didn't. We shambled for 20 minutes and asked everywhere for a table. Eventually our tries payed-off, we did get a table by a little "fast"food restaurant. At the and of dinner whe where barley on time to get to the square parça do comércio surrounded by police and thousands of people getting in.
                <br><br>
                There was a huge performance on the podium with a Portuguese band. With all does people on the square it was an amazing feeling and a great start of the night. From 12 o'clock it was a firework show for about 15 minutes and went on to a open air part with food/drink bars and enjoyable music. When i'm thinking about the view we had, I can't describe it (last picture). 
                Eventually we also went to a club and splitted later on again in two different groups 50/50. Some enjoyed the outside music more than the club so everyone had a excellent night and all did get back to the hotel around 5 am. 
                <br><br>
                When we came back 15 minutes from each other we did talked a bit, played cards and went to bed.
                <br><br>
                Till the next one!
