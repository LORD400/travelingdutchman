            Hi everybody! How do you do?
            <br><br>
            For today we had planned a privet guided tour to Fátima, Batalha, Nazaré & Óbidos! The drive, who is a perfect story teller and got an enjoyable personality, picked us up from the hotel in a 6 person mini-bus. From Lisbon we went first to Fátima, the home to the Sanctuary of Fátima, a Catholic pilgrimage site. It is one of the most religious places for the catholic church.
            On the opposite of the square, there is the third biggest overarching church in the world. From Fátima we went to Batalha and stopt therefor a short period of time to look inside the huge cathedral. It was astonishing how much time has gotten in the build of this building... most magnificent craft of there time.             
            <br><br>
            Next stop was Nazaré, on top of a cliff looking over the North Atlantic Ocean. Our guid also told us about the city that it's a great surfing spot. Waves can get higher than 10 meter around march, maybe a good reason to get back or not. 
            Given timetable for this stop was around two hours, so we could walk in the neighborhood of the beach go back and enjoyed the wether and the beautiful view, breath taking... (last picture).
            <br><br>
            After the time was spend we met in the center of the little village and ongoing to te next stop, called Óbidos. This place is an old castle with a huge wall around the other village. Within the main castle, it is turn to a ***** hotel, where you definitely can relax and see a great area.
            In the first picture you can see the idyllic location with an undergoing sun, great temperature and friends. Sometimes you can't go any better. At the and, our guid invited us for a little alcoholic characteristic drink called "Ginja". This drink is a kind of brandy, infused with sour cherries, sugar and cinnamon.
            Drinking is out of a chocolate shot cup, Ginja and the cherry, quite enjoyable! 
            <br><br>
            These four places and guided tour where again our best kind of experiences. Always advisable! On the way back in the mini-bus we had the great idea for a karaoke. It began with the Disney originals (Hakuna Matata) and ended in the most extreme kind of Dutch bar music (André Hazes), we all knew it... And the guid his experience was also fantastic, huge succes!!! 
            <br><br>
            Some time later in the evening, we went to a restaurant called La Tagliatella. The food was amazing, but almost nobody spoke English, wherefore the communication was a bit off. We ended our day the normal way, couple of card games, drinks and a good night sleep
            <br><br>
            Till tomorrow!
