            Hi everybody! How do you do?
            <br><br>
            For today we planned a privet tour to Fátima, Batalha, Nazaré & Óbidos! The ride, who is a perfect storyteller and has a funny personality and picked us up from the hotel in a 6-seater minivan. From Lisbon, we went first to Fátima, home to the Sanctuary of Fátima, a Catholic pilgrimage site. It is one of the most religious places for the Catholic Church.
            Across the square is also the third largest domed church in the world. From Fátima we went to Batalha and made a short stop there to view the huge cathedral from the inside. It was amazing how much time was put into the construction of this building... the most beautiful craft of it's time.
            <br><br>
            The next stop was Nazaré, on top of a cliff overlooking the North Atlantic Ocean. Our guide also told us about the city that it is a great surfing spot. Waves can get higher than 10 meters around March, maybe a good reason to go back or not?
            Since the timetable for this stop was about two hours, we could therefore walk near the beach and go back, enjoy the weather and the beautiful view, breathtaking... (last photo).
            <br><br>
            After the time was up, we met in the center of the small village and proceeded to the next stop called Óbidos. This place is an old castle with a huge wall around the village.
            Inside the main castle, it has been converted into a ***** hotel, where you can definitely relax and see an amazing environment.
            In the first picture you can see the idyllic location with the setting sun, wonderful temperature and friends. Sometimes you can't get it better. At the and our guide invited us for a small alcoholic signature drink called "Ginja". This drink is a kind of brandy, infused with sour cherries, sugar and cinnamon.
            Drinking is from a chocolate cup, Ginja inside and the cherry on top, very delicious! 
            <br><br>
            These four places and tour were again our best experiences. Always recommended! On the way back in the minibus we had the great idea for a karaoke. It started with the Disney originals (Hakuna Matata) and ended with the most extreme Dutch bar music (André Hazes). We all knew it... and the guide's experience was also fantastic, huge success!!!
            <br><br>
            Some time later in the evening we went to a restaurant called La Tagliatella. The food was great, but hardly anyone spoke English, so communication was a bit faltering. We ended our day in the normal way, a few card games, drinks and a good night's sleep.            
            <br><br>
            Till tomorrow!
