            Hi everybody! How do you do?
            <br><br>
            Today was the day, we didn't do much except go to the buffet. Yesterday was a long night so we weren't too excited for an early morning. Before anyone was ready to go out, I took a walk to a nearby park to relax a bit and went back to the hotel.
            Even though, if we wanted to do an activity, almost everything was closed until at least 4 pm. In the afternoon Marty and I went for a walk looking for lunch and we ended up at our hero, a small store with only overpriced stuff and sweets... It was a healthy lunch...
            <br><br>
            After about an hour and a half of walking in search of food, it started to rain heavily. Spoiler alert, it was the first and last moment of this vacation!!!
            Some time later we went to a restaurant called Yaso Lamen & Gyoza. Everyone had a different dish of Ramen and it all tasted amazing! But the amount was staggering, so much food, we couldn't handle it and had a lot of leftovers... For dessert there was a little muchi and a double espresso (nam-nam-nam).
            <br><br>
            Till tomorrow!
        </p>
