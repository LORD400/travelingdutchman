            <p>
                Hi everybody! How do you do?
                <br><br>
                My plan for today is to go to the Batanical garden, Zoological Museum, Frederik's Church & Nyhaven.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Batanical Garden</strong>
                <br>
                Just before the Batanical garden, another museum had an exhibition about the prehistoric species of modern people.
                When you bought a museum pass, there was a deal to do three activities in total.
                So first I started with the exhibition where there is a lot of information about Neandertals. 
                At that time of the vacation I also read the book "Sabiens, A Brief History Of Humankind" Where Professor Yuval Noah Harari writes about various theories about the total history of man and briefly how the earth and life came into being. Highly recommended! 
                Coming back to the exhibition, this has a lot of overlap and it also gives a better picture.
                <br><br>
                After the museum I went to the batanical garden.
                The advantage is that the two activities are connected through the park. 
                This makes for a nice nature walk to get further. On arrival there is a large field with greenhouses attached to it.
                In the greenhouses there are butterfly gardens, cactus areas and other tropical plants. 
                What is certainly to be taken into account is the temperature in the greenhouses. The air is extremely humid and over 40 degrees Celsius... 
                You can also get higher in the greenhouse through a spiral staircase and the view is beautiful, but even hotter.
                I still spent a reasonable amount of time there and it was time for lunch. 
                So looking for a bakery and back to the park.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Zoological Museum, Frederik's Church & Nyhaven</strong>
                <br>
                After the necessary rest period it was time for the Zoological Museum.
                Inside were various skeletons, stuffed animals, fakes and lots of interesting information. 
                As well as the largest clam of 180 cm from a fossil about 83 million years old.
                At the front of the museum there was another large lawn, where I continued reading my book in the shade of a tree.
                Finally, after some quiet reading, I went through the inner city and saw a beautiful church called the Frederki's church. 
                Finally, a short visit to Nyhaven and back to the hostel. 
                This was quite a long day and I hadn't done much, except read on.
                Later discuss our days with everyone and to bed, good night.
                <br><br>
                Till tomorrow!
            </p>
