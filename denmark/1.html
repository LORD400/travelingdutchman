                Hi everybody! How do you do?
                <br><br>
                It's my first time traveling alone!!! So as they say, there's a first for everything, let's call it a little experimental vacation.
                The relaxation behind it comes from the will to travel further and not be dependent on others.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Copenhagen airport early flight</strong>
                <br>
                My journey started around 6:30 am, the first time I flew alone.
                There was a bit of nervousness which I think is completely normal and after a few hours of waiting the plane took off.
                It was definitely a cheap flight, but I taught myself, why not get an extra legroom seat for a few extra dollars...
                <br><br>
                <strong>Arrival in Copenhagen</strong>
                <br>
                About two hours later the plane arrived at its destination and I had seen that there was a doable walk to the hostel so off I went.
                It was also a bit miscalculated, because the distance was a bit too long (2.5 hours with a backpack)... 
                Finally I reached the hostel Steel House Copenhagen. 
                The opening time was a few hours later for my room, so I waited, read a book and entered.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Meeting roommates</strong>
                <br>
                First roommate I met was a French guy out of Lyon and we introduced ourself to each other. Nice bloke of course. 
                Later that day in evening, I made my acquaintance with the other two out of Australia. 
                Also enjoyable personalities! 
                The nice thing to sleep with different strangers in the same room, everyone is doing some other things and most of the time, you talk about it with them before in the evening.
                Also your goals for the next day.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Exploring the city</strong>
                <br>
                Once all my stuff was dumped in the room, the exploring could begin.
                The main thing that stands out in Copenhagen and probably in all of Scandinavia is the expenditure.
                Even when I travel alone, I'm not particularly keen on eating out, which unintentionally saves a lot of money ;).
                In Copenhagen there are a number of interesting buildings and especially the parks. Every time you pass one you feel the need to go inside.
                Usually for breakfast, lunch and sometimes dinner I went to a bakery and took a to go to enjoy in the park.
                <br><br>
                For the day being, I saw a lot of cool things had some nice conversations, went back and had and ended the day, good night!
                <br><br>
                Till tomorrow!
            </p>
