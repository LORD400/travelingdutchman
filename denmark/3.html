                Hi everybody! How do you do?
                <br><br>
                My plan for today is to go to the City Hall, Libraries, Marathon, Little Mermaid & Kastellet Bro.
                <br><br>
                <strong>City Hall & Libraries</strong>
                <br>
                Today I looked on Google Maps for entertaining activities. 
                The first was the City Hall, which is a landmark building from 1905.
                In this building there is also a small old library with nice reading spots and a model of the building.

                An other room at the entrance, there is the Jens Olsen's World atomic Clock started in the year 1955. 
                The time it takes for the last gear to rotate is 25,753 years, what is insane. 
                It is almost entirely made out of brass and the creator couldn't have seen it, because it was made 10 years after his time.
                Very interesting time piece and I will be waiting for the whole rotation of the last gear...

                After this I went to the next library, the black diamond. This is definitely the nicest study space I've been to. 
                They have also a restored part of the old library and this is the study place where minimal/no noise is allowed.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Little Mermaid & Kastellet Bro</strong>
                <br>
                Later on, a little relaxation deliciousness from a bakery and a park.
                There is something special, the little mermaid. Of course I had to go here too. 
                The place is literally a stone in the water with a statue and at least 40 tourists in front.
                Next to it, there is a fortress where I spend a fair bit of time and was a watcher at a marathon.
                great stuff!
                For now, there is not much, I've got a early night because tomorrow to MÃ¤lmo Sweden!!! Good night! 
                <br><br>
                Till tomorrow!
            </p>
