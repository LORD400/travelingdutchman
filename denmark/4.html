                Hi everybody! How do you do?
                <br><br>
                For today I've planned a trip to Mälmo, on the opposite side of the water. 
                And for the first time in Sweden!   
                <br><br>
                <strong>Departure with a Flixbus</strong>
                <br>
                I got up early, at 6 am and went to the store to get some food and drink for the road.
                The bus stop was about 30 minutes from the accommodation and waited with a few other people.
                Finally it got there and we all got in.
                There are two ways to get to Mälmo, by train or bus/car.
                With a road transport it goes over the bridge and otherwise under water.
                And of course, crossing the bridge is definitely fun with an incredible view.
                When we got in customs, everyone was checked with ID and the simple 45 minute journey turned into four hours...
                About 9 people were rather illegal and left for the police station with a minimum of 20 police officers.
                It is terrible to see how they hope for a better life and then all get arrested.                
                <br><br>
                <strong>Day in Mälmo</strong>
                <br>
                We just stopped at the edge of the city and I walked first to the castle/fortress. 
                From inside there is a museum over the history of the place and some other informative biology stuff. 
                Interesting old castle.
                Just around the corner, there is a park with a windmill in it, quite nice.
                And now it's time go to the beach, by the beach they had some plateau's for entering and sun bathing spots.
                A real spectacular sight.
                And when I realized, I didn't bring my swimming shorts with me... 
                My life goal at that moment was getting something kinda appropriate. 
                And I did, Lidl saved me with a running short, hahaha.
                So I ran back, had a great swim and a wonderful few hours.
                When I finished I went to the center and saw Mälmo's backbone on the run.
                This building is a huge white revolving complex and it naturally looks like a spine.
                In the center there were a number of beautiful old buildings and next to it were some relaxing parks.
                This was my entertaining day in Mälmo.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Getting back to Copenhagen</strong>
                <br>
                At the and of the day, I waited by the bus stop until it arrived. 
                Got in and within 40 minutes arrived at my destination, Copenhagen.
                At arrival, we talked a bit over our experiences for the day in the hostel and went to bed, good night!
                <br><br>
                Till tomorrow!
