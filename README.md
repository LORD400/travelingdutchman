Hello World,

My name is Damian Keinemans. This is my cs50 final project called the Traveling Dutchman. It is a simple blog page used to describe my journeys around the globe. For this project I used HTML for the webpages, CSS styling oriented and JavaScript to implement some actions and import custom HTML templates.

To get started with the Homepage, it got a menu bar with several subpages. The first part of the start screen shows the upcoming journey and also a small overview of the last journeys. Blogs show the most recent posts at the end of the page and a link to all of them. This website is also mobile friendly as you can see here.

What we see here is an overview of all blogs together. All titles are also clickable and lead you to the specific journey. When an image is clicked, it shifts to the side.

When the map is opened from the menu bar, a Google map is automatically opened via HTML code.

For the sake of programming, I told you about the different languages ​​used. And so it's time to get a little more specific. Due to the many different blogs, photos and travels, the number of files is large and will continue to grow. If we look in the index, there are the import codes of the templates.

include HTML files is done with JavaScript as shown. And some other functions.

CSS was used for the styling in various files for the page, stylebar and swiper

and so, in total, we have different HTML files for the pages and templates, a couple of css files for the styling and JavaScript files for different functions.

This was my cs50 Final Project Traveling Dutchman. My name is Damian Keinemans and this was cs50.
