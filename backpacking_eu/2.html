            <p>                
                Hi everybody, how do you do?
                <br><br>
                The first city Brussels is already done. 
                So I went on a train to Luxembourg station at 9:38 a.m. at Brussel central. 
                About the train ride everything went smooth, except the missing outlet. 
                Therefore, my laptop went out and I couldn't update my blog at the time I wanted. 
                But there will also be an other moment to complete my self given task. 
                Around 1 o'clock the train arrived at its end destination. 
                And the exploration begins.
                <br><br>
                <strong>View, Cardio & Arrival</strong>
                <br>
                Walking through Luxembourg is already a beautiful sight as it is. 
                The main component about the "hike" is definitely the altitude. 
                Normally it doesn't bother me, except the backpack with a weight far over the 20 kg is harder with the huge clime for 40 minutes. 
                Cardio done for today! 
                Finally I arrived at my hostel called "Youth Hostel Luxembourg City". 
                Everything is very clean, spacious and seen on the online pics, breakfast should be good.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Exploring the city & Lunch</strong>
                <br>
                When fully installed with all my stuff, it's time to go to the city. 
                After a short night, I'm a bit tired, so let's see how far I get. 
                And the hostel is located at the beginning of a high bridge that you have to conquer. 
                And when your so high, it's the view is amazing. 
                Probably the part where Luxembourg, apart from finance, is most famous for.
                In the center I bought a very fine pulled chicken sandwich and went on to the park with a nice sitting area.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Hostel, Programming, & Roommates</strong>
                <br>
                Just after the lunch I did some sightseeing for some time and went back to the hostel. 
                Two of my four roommates (france guys) where in the room and we got to know each other. 
                The seconde thing I did was to take a shower after the sweaty walk. 
                I felt reborn and just looked up a place in the hostel to work a bit on this story's. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Live Performances & park</strong>
                <br>
                Some time later just in the early evening, all over the city of where live performances (listen to the audio file below).
                So a great opportunity to spend the night!
                The first band I encountered was a rock/blues band performing with a really chill vibe.
                When I found a table with some chairs, a German bloke asked if he can join me (of course).
                Trying my best for my german speaking capabilities, we had some nice little conversations and very much enjoyed the ambiance, music all of it.
                Just before sitting down, I made a painful mistake... ordering a beer without knowing the price... 10 euro's further...
                Doesn't matter, it's so far a amusing evening.
                After a while I was interested in an other genre and explored a bit more.
                It was also just a bit early so chose to read just a couple chapters in a park.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Conversations & sunset</strong>
                <br>
                When I walked a bit to capture the sunset at the right moment, there was a lovely lady standing out of South Korea.
                It was great to have that moment and the time flew by. 
                One of the things I learned is how my name is written in Korean and some other thinks about the language.
                Almost an hour went by and we just appreciated the moment, also a great sunset again. 
                At the right moment, I went back to the hostel and also met the other two guy who are traveling separately.
                Interesting guys, one out of Brazil, living in Dublin and studying English for six years. 
                The other one is from Barcelona, living in Copenhagen traveling as a hobby in his weekend over the world. 
                Last weekend he was in Moldova, living his best life!
                The great thing about traveling alone, everybody is keen to every bit of travel what they can get.
                Just wrote a bit in bed, some editing and ended the day. Good night!
                <br><br>
                Till tomorrow!

            Hi everybody, how do you do?
            <br><br>
            <strong>Breakfast, Cathedral de Notre-Dame & statue</strong>
            <br>
            Today I started a bit early and took a quick shower. Right after the breakfast was very nice with the breakfast options.
            In comparison with Brussels the old castle sight of the town from Luxembourg is really amazing to see in the morning.
            In this time there was the opportunity to think about the prospects for today.
            So, later on, I went to the city center and looked to some other parts I haven't seen yet.
            Luxembourg got also an cathedral called Notre-Dame and after a bit walking over the nearby bridge, I entered.
            Magnificent all the stained glass, definitely a special craft.
            Somewhere around the corner there was also an other statue about the fallen in WWII.
            About a hour goes by and I went to the next location.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Luxembourg American Cemetery</strong>
            <br>
            The military cemetery & memorial site for America WWII, is as impressive as it should be, almost 80 years after the war and it looks like they made it yesterday. 
            That's what you call respect for the dead and it's fully funded by the American government, what also impressed me.
            So I went by bus to the nearest bus stop about 20 minutes walking from the sanctuary.
            9 o'clock a.m. is the openingstime and spot on, the doors opened and the bells where going.
            On this location there lie 5.070 service members in total fallen in war.
            I hope you can get an idea from the picture how massive it is.
            <br><br>
            Salute!
            <br><br>
            <strong>Lunch, Sunbathing & Exercise</strong>
            <br>
            I left around half a hour later and went back with the bus to the city center.
            A very important task is to get some souvenirs from every location and that box is now checked again.
            For Lunch I went to store whom sold fresh sandwiches.
            Chosen was a tuna sandwich with some extras.
            When eating my lunch in a park, there was some sunbathing and that brought me a very original idea.
            In that time, I also did some exercise to try to stay a bit in shape and enjoyed the moment.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Pint, programming & fortress</strong>
            <br>
            After a while I was a bit toasted so went back to the hotel, took my laptop and a Luxembourg original pilsner pint.
            Very delicious and a great view again. 
            I was trying some stuff out for my website and working on the stories. 
            Some time later my last mission was to go to the Fortress Obergrünewald and the museum in the other Fortress Thüngen.
            It was a small hike, if your walking with the right footwear, in my case flipflops.
            Up the mountain is the first fortress and also the stairways to heaven...
            On the top is a smaller fortress aka museum over the history from the city Luxembourg. 
            Quite nice and well put together. 
            All the used items are also out of the location or from attacks to Luxembourg long ago.
            When going down, away from the mountain, I went one last time to the city for some dinner.
            After eating it in a park and relaxing a bit I went back to the dorms and took a shower.
            Then layed in bed, of course talked about our day, little bit of editing and ended the day.
            Good Night!
            <br><br>
            Till tomorrow!

                Hi everybody, How do you do?
                <br><br>
                Today is the departure from Luxembourg to Paris. 
                The same as before, my time in Luxembourg has come to an end. 
                And the last things I did, weren't very memorable, just to get ready for leaving at 7:00 am. 
                First I Took a bus to the P+R Bouillon and from there with I went with a Flixbus to Paris Bercy.
                <br><br>
                See you in the next Blog!

                <strong>My thought process about Luxembourg</strong> 
                <br>
                Luxembourg is more like how a city could be, totally clean, perfect streets, free public transport and respectful manners between people (what I've seen). 
                And the main question, how did they do it? Yeh, it probably got something to do with how expensive everything is and a big economical player in the world. 
                But I can honestly say, it takes a couple extra bucks, definitely worth it!
