            <p>
                Hi everybody! How do you do?
                <br><br>
                And here we go again!!! Today is the first day of many days backpacking through Europe. 
                I'm pretty amazed about it, because it happened so fast from the beginning of planning till today.  
                Hopefully you can enjoy my little stories about the experiences in this journey!
                <br><br>
                <strong>Train to Brussels & lunch</strong>
                <br>
                My journey started with a the train from Amsterdam at 11:28 am to the city of Brussels.
                Maybe one of the best things I've done is first class trains, outlets, big chairs en less crowded. 
                In this time I made some changes for the website where you reading this blog and make it ready for the last pieces of text.
                After an hour of programming, I looked up some activities for later that day.
                about 2.5 hours later I arrived and went to the hostel called Youth Hostel Jacques Brel. 
                When in the dorms, I made my bed, put my backpack in the corner and was ready for exploring.
                At first, it's always kinda tricky to get used to a city, where to go for the main activities.
                So I started to get some food by a little bakery called Brian Joyeux. 
                It was actually a little pastry shop with a lot of very expansive pastries. 
                They sold also some kind of bread pizza's and my choice was made.
                <br><br>
                <strong>St Michael and St Gudula Cathedral. & Manneken Pis</strong>
                <br>
                Later on, I walked to the St Michael and St Gudula Cathedral. 
                Beautiful building as so many and I keep value them. 
                When seen enough, I walked to the next location called the Grand Place. 
                This place was an old market located in the center of Brussels. 
                Now it's more an empty space with amazing buildings around it as well as some restaurants.
                But now, it's finally time for the best Brussels has to offer, Manneken Pis. 
                It's a little statue of a boy who is pissing. 
                Some people also regularly change the clothing of this statue, as you can see, now it has a three piece suit. 
                And sometimes you can spot him naked ðŸ‘€...
                <br><br>
                <strong>Brussels Waffle, Ferris Wheel, Porte de Hal & a Pint</strong>
                <br>
                Walking a bit further, I saw a ferris wheel and thought by myself, why not. 
                So I went on and right before, I got the real Brussels waffle with Nutella ðŸ˜‹. 
                Of course on the top of the ferris wheel you had a total view of Brussels which was a great picture moment!
                Then saw Porte de Hal, a museum of Brussels history in the 14th-century fortified city gate. 
                And now it's time for beer, but where... 
                earlier I walked past a cafÃ© called cafÃ© Novo and they have a little space between the buildings where you can sit pretty quite from the outside noise. 
                After a pint pilsener I went back to the hostel and had a long enjoyable conversation with a girl out of Australia.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Sunset</strong>
                <br>
                I ended my day with a last walk across the city and took the time to see the sunset.
                And when I entered the dorms, my roommates where also there. 
                Three great blokes out of New Zealand! So as usual in hostels, you talk about each others experience and plans for the next day.
                <br><br>
                Entertaining first day!
                <br><br>
                Till tomorrow!

            Hi everybody, how do you do?
            <br><br>
            For the first night I had an unexpected good night sleep. 
            The bed was quite comfortable. 
            Only the instability was maximized to a 100%.
            I began to go down stairs to the first floor for breakfast. 
            They offer a basic buffet just to start the day. 
            Afterwards I refreshed myself with a shower and of course a new full body sunscreen protection.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Botanical Garden, Church, exhibition Baroque the Florence</strong>
            <br>
            So, now I'm ready and started with a visit to the Botanical Garden. 
            It's a huge park with a big greenhouse for tropical plants. 
            I already did almost the same thing on Copenhagen, where they also have a Botanical Garden.
            I had a great time and went to an other church near the hostel. 
            Unfortunately it was closed, but the outside was already spectacular. 
            Further in the direction of the grand place, there was an exhibition called Baroque the Florence. 
            There was a fair bit of paintings out of the Renaissance period. 
            Florence was than a huge economical and scientific city, also had a lot of masters of art.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Reading Time and Lunch</strong>
            <br>
            Just after the museum, I took some time to read in my pocket edition book titled: "The Art Of War, Sun Tzu". 
            Probably most are already familiar with the name. 
            It's about a great Chinese military commander around 6th Century BC, who wrote a really specific strategy for warfare. 
            But nowadays, it's more used to outsmart your opponent in the modern world.
            After some reading I went to a store to get some food and searched a great location. 
            A bit later, I got some goat cheese with bacon surrounded and two other pastries. 
            And ended the lunch in CafÃ© Leffe brasserie with a pint Leffe blond. 
            Also had an other enjoyable conversation with a Polish guy who works for the Polish embassy. 
            This guy got some great tips and info about Poland and just appreciated each others presence.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Church, Royal Museum & Hostel</strong>
            <br>
            Later on, I went to an other church called Notre Dame de la Church is a grothic romanasque church dating back to 1134. 
            And than went directly to the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium, spent some time inside and left (they also have a Dutch division). 
            Walking back to the hostel there was an other opportunity to get an other waffle and I took itðŸ˜Š.
            When back in the hostel I took some time to rest after about 25 km of walking today. 
            Some time later my roommates came back out of Brugges and did enjoy there days as well.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Dinning</strong>
            <br>
            Again, a bit later on, we met at a grand street food place in the center where we dined together and spent some time in the evening. 
            Walked a bit through the city, went back, chilled and ended the day. Sleep well!
            <br><br>
            Till Tomorrow!
            
        </p>

        Hi everybody, How do you do?
        <br><br>
        Today is the departure from Brussels to Luxembourg. 
        So, my time in Brussels has come to an end. 
        The last things I did, weren't very memorable, just to get ready for leaving.
        <br><br>
        See you in the next Blog!
        </p>
