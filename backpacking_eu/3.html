            <p>                
                Hi everybody, how do you do?
                
                <br><br>
                <strong>FlixBus, metro, hotel</strong>
                <br>
                As I said before in the ending at the last blog, there was a delay for 1.5 hours with the FlixBus, so my day was a bit shortened in Paris. 
                Therefore when arrived after more delays, I went directly to the hotel with the metro from the train/bus station Paris Bercy next to Gare de Lyon.
                Eventually from the hostel in Luxembourg to the hotel in Paris, it took me from 7:00 am to 16:00 pm, 9 hours of traveling in a row.
                That's part of the deal.
                To get back to the accommodation, for this city I've booked a one guest bedroom in Hotel des Pyréréens with my own desk, fridge, shower, toilet, tv and the most important air conditioning!
                My first impression is comfortable for an acceptable prizing one guest bedroom for a hotel in Paris. 
                It's also a short period of time to have a little privacy.
                The strange thing is that I expected to have more the need for my own space, but it's more like the opposite.
                In a hostel, the vibe is more enjoyable when your traveling alone and I don't mind some "noise" from roommates.
                Nice to know that's my opinion nowadays!
                For the first relaxing hour, I took a shower, reorganized my stuff and went of to explore!

                <strong>Notre Dame, crepe Seine & louvre</strong>
                <br>    
                First thoughts coming to mind is the Eiffel Tower and directly as seconde, the Cathedral Notre-Dame. 
                I probably have a clue why it is. The disney movie "The Hunchback of the Notre Dame". 
                This was a movie I very much enjoyed as a child and was already mesmerized bij an animation movie about Paris.
                And so on, I finally had the chance to see most of the building from outside!
                Most of us also know what happened to the building... 
                It was while renovating cigarette or short circuit in the electrical system.
                Small mistake with catastrophical result.
                And getting back to the moment, it was very amazing to see the cathedral, a defined recommendation!
                <br><br>
                An other important topic of today, crépe. 
                It's more like a thin pancake with a chosen topping. 
                I saw a crépe and waffle stand when I walked over a bridge above the seine from the direction of the Notre-Dame.
                A lot of people said, when your in Paris, eat a crépe and a eclair.
                So, one of them is already being checked. 
                And it was delicious! 
                After buying, I went back a little to have the best experience, a view of the Seine with the Notre-Dame in the background and a crépe in my hand.
                Because of my "late" arrival, Louvre was already closed, so I looked around the beautiful glass pyramid and the amazing architecture.
                Just some time later, I went to the entree of the Tuileries Garden, and then something else happened...
                <br><br>
                <strong>Heavy rain and a Guinness</strong>
                <br>
                When entering, I felt some little drops on my head and thought, it can't be, so ignored the first feeling.
                I've never been more wrong...
                The wind was stronger, blew away a lot of chairs and the fountain water all over.
                There was definitely a spectacular part of this moment, but then, almost everyone went already to some dry places.
                From this moment it was a very heavy thunder/rain storm for in total 1.5 hours and was tot soaking wet.
                I ran to a dry spot and walked a bit passing a lot of souvenir shops.
                Eventually the rain was just poring and I wanted to do something.
                I searched for a nice bar were I sit down, have a beer and dry a bit.
                The bar Caveau Montpensier got a lot of UK beer and chose a pint of Guinness, really nice at this specific time.           
                <br><br>
                <strong>Place De La Concorde & Palais Bourbon</strong>
                <br>
                Half an hour later the raining had come to an end!
                Now it's time to see some more parts of Paris.
                The other I walked by was Place De La Concorde. It's a huge Pilar.
                This Pilar surrounded by fountains and statues is actually an Egyptian obelisk.
                Place De La Concorde was some time back in time around 1772 the official execution for the France Revolution. 
                From there it's crossing the bridge and your standing before Palais Bourbon.
                I walked by an appreciated the sight!

                <strong>Eiffel Tower & Arc de Triomphe</strong>
                <br>
                Later on, I went in the length of the Seine to get to the Eiffel Tower.
                One of the most famous locations in the world.
                And now I'm understanding why, it's very massive to see and brown.
                The color is something I never knew.
                Lots of the pictures most of us see, is a black impressive iron tower. 
                This tower was to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the France Revolution.
                Gustave Eiffel was the architect who made the plans about the tower and was opened in the year 1889.
                I didn't got on the building but was under it and around, getting on it is for the next time!
                <br><br>
                When I had enough, there was also Arc de Triomphe. 
                Of course a place you don't want to miss.
                The main reasons for not getting on specific building is more the queue. 
                I'm not waiting more than 30 minutes when only being here for two nights and I can very much enjoy the view from the food of the buildings.
                And Arc de Triomphe was again very amazing. 
                All the time and effort there goes in to making the buildings and statues is just astonishing.
                So, I ended the exploring for today in Paris and went back to my hotel room. 
                For halve a day it was an very long and dynamic one. 
                Good night!
                <br><br>
                Till tomorrow!

            Hi everybody, how do you do? 
            <br><br>
            Starting today was a bit strange. 
            So much to do in one day.
            Unfortunately I can't say I've got a great night of sleep again. 
            But that doesn't matter, because it's gonna be amazing!
            First I wanted to get a little relaxation and said to myself, don't go out your room until it's at least 9 o'clock.
            I began with a cold shower around 5 o'clock and thought about the day. 
            Just an hour later I started a little with editing again, because yesterday was also pretty much.

            <strong>Louvre, Panthéon & Library</strong>
            <br>
            And as said, I left my room around 9 o'clock and went directly to museum du Louvre. 
            Earlier I spoke about a maximum waiting time of 30 minutes.
            When you arrive around 9:30, its impossible.
            The queue was over 4 hours of waiting so many people I couldn't believe it...
            So, I made a picture of all those people in line and laughed.
            Museum Du Louver is just for the next time, I didn't mind it at all.
            <br><br>
            Now it's time for the old    
            
            <br><br>
            <strong>Eclairs</strong>

            <br><br>
            <strong>The basilica of the Scared Heart of Paris</strong>
            <br>
            <br><br>

            <strong>Couchsurfing app</strong>
            <br>
            Ut
            <br><br>
            Till tomorrow!
