            <p>                
                Hi everybody, how do you do?
                
                <br><br>
                <strong>FlixBus, metro, hotel</strong>
                <br>
                As I said before in the ending at the last blog, there was a delay for 1.5 hours with the FlixBus, so my day was a bit shortened in Paris. 
                Therefore when arrived after more delays, I went directly to the hotel with the metro from the train/bus station Paris Bercy next to Gare de Lyon.
                Eventually from the hostel in Luxembourg to the hotel in Paris, it took me from 7:00 am to 16:00 pm, 9 hours of traveling in a row.
                That's part of the deal.
                To get back to the accommodation, for this city I've booked a one guest bedroom in Hotel des Pyréréens with my own desk, fridge, shower, toilet, tv and the most important air conditioning!
                My first impression is comfortable for an acceptable prizing one guest bedroom for a hotel in Paris. 
                It's also a short period of time to have a little privacy.
                The strange thing is that I expected to have more the need for my own space, but it's more like the opposite.
                In a hostel, the vibe is more enjoyable when your traveling alone and I don't mind some "noise" from roommates.
                Nice to know that's my opinion nowadays!
                For the first relaxing hour, I took a shower, reorganized my stuff and went of to explore!

                <strong>Notre Dame, crepe Seine & louvre</strong>
                <br>    
                First thoughts coming to mind is the Eiffel Tower and directly after, the Cathedral de Notre-Dame. 
                I probably have a clue why it is, the disney movie "The Hunchback of the Notre Dame". 
                This was a movie I very much enjoyed as a child and was already mesmerized by an animation movie about Paris.
                And so on, I finally had the chance to see a lot of the building from outside!
                Most of us also know what happened to the building... 
                It was while renovating cigarette or short circuit in the electrical system.
                Small mistake with a catastrophical result.
                And getting back to the moment, it was very amazing to see the cathedral, a definite recommendation!
                <br><br>
                An other important topic of today, crépe. 
                It's more like a thin pancake with a chosen topping or naturel. 
                I saw a crépe and waffle stand when walking over a bridge above the Seine from the direction of the Notre-Dame.
                A lot of people said, when you're in Paris, eat a crépe and an eclair.
                So, one of them is already being checked. 
                After buying, I went back a little to have the best experience, a view of the Seine with the Notre-Dame in the background and a crépe in my hand.
                It was delicious! 
                Because of my "late" arrival, Louvre was already closed, so I looked around the beautiful glass pyramid and the amazing architecture.
                Just some time later, I went to the entree of the Tuileries Garden, and then something else happened...
                <br><br>
                <strong>Heavy rain and a Guinness</strong>
                <br>
                When entering, I felt some little drops on my head and thought, it can't be, so ignored the first feeling.
                I've never been more wrong...
                The wind was stronger, blew away a lot of chairs and the fountain water all over.
                There was definitely a spectacular part of this moment, but then, almost everyone went already to some dry places.
                From this moment it was a very heavy thunder/rain storm for in total 1.5 hours and was tot soaking wet.
                I ran to a dry spot and walked a bit passing a lot of souvenir shops.
                Eventually the rain was just poring and I wanted to do something.
                I searched for a nice bar were I sit down, have a beer and dry a bit.
                The bar Caveau Montpensier got a lot of UK beer and chose a pint of Guinness, really nice at this specific time.           
                <br><br>
                <strong>Place De La Concorde & Palais Bourbon</strong>
                <br>
                Half an hour later the raining had come to an end!
                Now it's time to see some more parts of Paris.
                The other I walked by was Place De La Concorde. It's a huge Pilar.
                This Pilar surrounded by fountains and statues is actually an Egyptian obelisk.
                Place De La Concorde was some time back in time around 1772 the official execution for the France Revolution. 
                From there it's crossing the bridge and your standing before Palais Bourbon.
                I walked by an appreciated the sight!

                <strong>Eiffel Tower & Arc de Triomphe</strong>
                <br>
                Later on, I went in the length of the Seine to get to the Eiffel Tower.
                One of the most famous locations in the world.
                And now I'm understanding why, it's very massive to see and brown.
                The color is something I never knew.
                Lots of the pictures most of us see, is a black impressive iron tower. 
                This tower was to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the France Revolution.
                Gustave Eiffel was the architect who made the plans about the tower and was opened in the year 1889.
                I didn't got on the building but was under it and around, getting on it is for the next time!
                <br><br>
                When I had enough, there was also Arc de Triomphe. 
                Of course a place you don't want to miss.
                The main reasons for not getting on specific building is more the queue. 
                I'm not waiting more than 30 minutes when only being here for two nights and I can very much enjoy the view from the food of the buildings.
                And Arc de Triomphe was again very amazing. 
                All the time and effort there goes in to making the buildings and statues is just astonishing.
                So, I ended the exploring for today in Paris and went back to my hotel room. 
                For halve a day it was an very long and dynamic one. 
                Good night!
                <br><br>
                Till tomorrow!

            Hi everybody, how do you do? 
            <br><br>
            Starting today was a bit strange. 
            So much to do in one day.
            Unfortunately I can't say I've got a great night of sleep again. 
            But that doesn't matter, because it's gonna be amazing!
            First I wanted to get a little relaxation and said to myself, don't go out your room until it's at least 9 o'clock.
            I began with a cold shower around 5 o'clock and thought about the day. 
            Just an hour later I started a little with editing again, because yesterday was also pretty much.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Louvre, Panthéon & Library</strong>
            <br>
            And as said, I left my room around 9 o'clock and went directly to museum du Louvre. 
            Earlier I spoke about a maximum waiting time of 30 minutes.
            When you arrive around 9:30, it's impossible.
            The queue was over 4 hours of waiting so many people I couldn't believe it...
            So, I made a picture of all those people in line and laughed.
            Museum Du Louver is just for the next time, I didn't mind it at all.
            <br><br>
            Now it's time for the 18th-century mausoleum, also known as Panthéon.
            This big monumental place is much better to see then to read about it.
            Go back take a notable moment to really see the building and that's the best description there is. 
            At the top t you also got the possibility to go up-stairs for 256 steps.
            It's a bit hard, especially when walking almost 150 km in 6 days, but it doable.
            When eventually by the panorama view, you can see every attraction in whole Paris, amazing!
            Very munch liked this experience, there was just a queue which met my standards, below the 30 minutes mark.
            <br><br>
            While walking back in the direction of the Seine, there was also an other thing I was keen on seeing, called Institute de France.
            In here they have an old library filled with historical books.
            It's also a working spot where you have to be really quiet and when you're just sightseeing do at as fast as possible.
            Respect the place and it's all right to have a look inside.        
            <br><br>
            <strong>Eclairs</strong>
            From this moment on, I'm getting a bit hungry and thought by myself, what was the other most important snack I should take... Eclairs!
            Eclairs are also my mothers most liked snack.
            She gave me the tip as well, so after the first one I was sold!
            Went directly back and also tried out the coffee flavor, FANTASTIC!

            <strong>basílica del sacré cœur</strong>
            <br>
            There was one big thing left on my list I real want check, called basílica del sacré cœur.
            This place is an iconic church in the North Paris domed white and completed in 1914. 
            But before i'm there, I have got to encounter the stairs again...
            It's about a 40 minute walk uphill including many, many stairs.
            When halfway, I got some warm mini pizza's and a little bottle of wine to enjoy at the top for lunching.
            And went again for the last part of the "hike".
            Eventually totally sweaty, I arrived, sat down and the view was spectacular.
            There are so many great experiences already in this trip already, sometimes it's hard to comprehend.
            On the top of this "mountain", there are of course so many tourists, including myself. 
            Except I brought my own wine and mini pizza's for te lunch.
            <br><br>

            From this specific point of view, there is a total city before you while eating and drinking great stuff.
            Just right from me, there was also a live performance witch we all loved so much.
            One homeless guy after a couple of beers also some swing.
            He Just started dancing, a real performer, got everyone to clap on specific moments and took some in the dance circle.
            It's for sure something I didn't expected and very much enjoyed it.
            His name is Pére and speaks quite good English.
            Later on walking back to my hotel, I mentally and physically totally done.
            Just type a bit when you get back and that's it, I hoped.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Couchsurfing (CS)</strong>
            <br>
            Walked back to the hotel and was mentally and physically totally done.
            So, the idea was to write already about the last day, with the thought to upload it already in portions.
            Except, I put my laptop on my bed, plugged it in and fell asleep for three hours.
            I probably needed it.
            When woken up around 5 o'clock, I did use the app Couchsurfing for the first time for planning a hangout.
            A hangout is when people have not particularly much to do, but want to meet some new people.
            In this case, I messaged Ut, who wants a beer in a bar on the riverside.
            From this moment I thought, is this really save...
            But the best thing about it, you can read almost the whole identity, reference from other people about him and trust you gut.
            If there is doubt, just ask some else.
            <br><br>
            So I went with the metro to Saint-Paul and meeted him before a store.
            Just talking we went in there to get some drinks for later on.
            On this specific moment I was thinking, how easy it could be.
            The most important is, while traveling to make new friends and get new experiences.
            For a long time we sat down by the river the Seine.
            Talking about traveling, personal stuff and lots of other thinks.
            After some time, we took a walk right next to the river in the direction of the Eiffel Tower, stayed a bit on the bridge famous for it's locks.
            Only all the locks where removed because of the weight.
            <br><br>
            After some time we went to the direction of my hotel, but first in searching for food.
            A lot of places in a sort of China Town were not open anymore, but after the 5th time we got something!
            Very delicious hot dumplings, we took the to an other place were we ordered some beers by Social Square.
            It's in the corner where you can sit before the bar and just see the street, eat delicious food and talk...
            After about 7 hours, we had a very great night and made already appointments for the next time in the Netherlands!
            <br><br>
            Ut my friend, thank you very much and till August!
            <br><br>
            Good night and till tomorrow!

                Hi everybody, how do you do?
                <br><br>
                As usual, on the departure day, nothing much is happening in the morning.
                My plan was to go to Père Lachaise Cemetery, but with a small hangover and keen to write some more, I just stayed till 10 o'clock and left to Gare de Lyon with the metro.
                From here, I waited 40 minutes and went in the train.
                This one was the most luxurious so far.
                <br><br>
                And then Paris came to an end. I very much enjoyed it and will definitely go back there.
                <br><br>
                See you in the next blog!
            </p>
